  body: This class implements a source for SVN environments.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: An SVN source generates environments by enumerating the branches and trunk for a given SVN remote. SVN repositories must conform to the conventional SVN repository structure with the directories trunk/, branches/, and optionally tags/ in the root of the repository. The trunk/ directory is specifically mapped to the production environment, branches are created as environments with the name of the given branch.

Centos/RHEL Release RPMS with r10k
=========
By Jon Kelley

I've cut some RPM's and included the .spec files and source RPMs for your pleasure. After install /usr/bin/r10k should work on your Centos/RHEL based system.

These packages were generated with the incredibly useful tool found here https://github.com/jonkelleyatrackspace/make_rpms_from_gems
